# ShifaAI
# Pathology AI Patient Simulation

**Your AI health companion: instant medical answers, supportive CBT coaching, and holistic healing guidance.**

An AI-driven patient simulation platform for pathology and medical Q\&A that combines:

* **Medical FAQ Scraper**: Automatically gathers frequently asked questions from trusted medical sources.
* **GPT-4 Medical Engine**: Leverages GPT-4 API to provide accurate, up-to-date medical answers.
* **Empathetic & Optimistic Tone**: Wraps answers in sympathetic language to encourage hope and improvement.
* **CBT Coaching Module**: Appends simple Cognitive Behavioral Therapy exercises to each response.
* **Islamic-Compliant “Shifa AI” Layer**: Integrates prophetic medicine recommendations and du‘ā based on authentic sources.
* **CLI Demo**: `ai_simulator.py` for quick command-line interactions and demos.
* **Chrome Extension UI**: Lightweight in-browser chat widget for easy access.

## Features

* **Web Scraping Pipeline**: Python-based scrapers (Scrapy/BeautifulSoup) to collect and preprocess medical FAQs.
* **FastAPI Backend**: Exposes REST endpoints for Q\&A, CBT exercises, and Shifa recommendations.
* **GPT-4 Orchestration**: Central router with system prompts for medical expertise and coaching.
* **Modular CBT Engine**: ABC model, thought records, and guided exercises.
